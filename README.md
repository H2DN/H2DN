# H¬≤DN: Heterogeneity-Homogeneity Discovery Network  
### Code for the paper *‚ÄúMachine learning based homogeneity‚Äìheterogeneity coupled complex network dynamics discovery‚Äù*

---

## üìò Overview
This repository contains a **primitive implementation** of the paper *‚ÄúMachine learning based homogeneity‚Äìheterogeneity coupled complex network dynamics discovery‚Äù*.  
We propose the **Heterogeneity-Homogeneity Discovery Network (H¬≤DN)** ‚Äî a two-stage framework for discovering the **governing equations of complex networks** directly from observational data.

H¬≤DN simultaneously captures:
- **Group-level homogeneous dynamics**, shared among similar nodes.  
- **Individual-level heterogeneous dynamics**, unique to each node.  

This enables **interpretable**, **robust**, and **generalizable** discovery of network dynamics across various real-world systems.

> A more mature and fully documented version of H¬≤DN will be publicly available on GitHub **after the paper is accepted**.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Differentiable L‚ÇÄ regularization**: Enables sparse and interpretable discovery of governing equations through continuous relaxation of discrete term selection. 
- **Sparse regression formulation**: Employs differentiable regularization for optimal balance between complexity and accuracy.  
- **Robustness to missing data**: Performs reliably under incomplete or noisy observations.  
- **Cross-domain generalization**: Validated on both synthetic and real-world networks, including:
  - Urban mobility systems  
  - Power grids  
  - Epidemic spreading models  
  - Climate dynamics

## üß© Code Description

This demo includes three representative experiments:

1. **Synthetic Network Example**  
   This includes both *single-dynamics* and *multi-dynamics* complex networks.  
   It illustrates how **H¬≤DN** identifies group-level homogeneous and individual-level heterogeneous dynamics in a controlled synthetic environment.

2. **Real-world Network Example**  
   This experiment involves multiple real-world systems, including the **global climate network**, **European power grid**, **monkeypox transmission network**, **urban rail transit network**, and **urban road traffic network**.  
   It demonstrates how H¬≤DN infers governing laws and predicts node states from empirical observational data.

3. **Incomplete Data Experiment**  
   This test evaluates the robustness of H¬≤DN under incomplete and sparse observations, showing its ability to maintain reliable performance even with missing data.

> Currently, we release only the **synthetic dynamics** experiment code.  
> The full implementation, including all the above experiments, will be made publicly available **after the paper is accepted**.

Each example follows the two-stage inference process:

- **Stage 1** ‚Äì Infer group-level homogeneous dynamics.  
- **Stage 2** ‚Äì Identify node-level heterogeneous dynamics.
